# XProxy

XProxy is a small project I made to create a proxy for web application pentests and bug bounty hunting.

# Description

XProxy aims to save your sessions, the data stored if you want to stop your search in progress without starting all over again, by exporting in JSON format.

The tool has important features:
- Proxy: allows you to intercept requests and modify them as you wish
- Repeater: allows you to test several requests in a row without going through the web application again
- Fuzzer: test several parameters coming from a wordlist, such as possible key values in the URL, users, passwords, etc.
- Discovery: Enumeration of directories and files
